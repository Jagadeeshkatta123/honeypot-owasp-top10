  <h1>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h1>
  <p>Cross-Site Scripting allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, enabling them to steal sensitive information, such as session cookies.</p>
  <p>Example: Injecting a malicious script into a user comment section that is executed by other users' browsers.</p>

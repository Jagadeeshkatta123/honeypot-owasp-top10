  <h1>Insufficient Logging and Monitoring</h1>
  <p>Without adequate logging and monitoring, attackers can exploit an application without being detected. This makes it difficult to respond to attacks in a timely manner.</p>
  <p>Example: Failing to log failed login attempts, which allows brute-force attacks to go unnoticed.</p>

  <h1>Insecure Design</h1>
  <p>Insecure Design refers to flaws in the design phase of a web application, making it easier for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities. This could include improper authentication, weak encryption, etc.</p>
  <p>Example: An application that doesn't implement role-based access controls (RBAC) properly, allowing unauthorized users access to sensitive data.</p>

  <h1>Vulnerable and Outdated Components</h1>
  <p>Using components with known vulnerabilities, such as outdated libraries, frameworks, or operating systems, can open the door to exploits. Attackers can take advantage of these vulnerabilities to compromise an application.</p>
  <p>Example: An outdated version of jQuery or an old web framework with known vulnerabilities.</p>
